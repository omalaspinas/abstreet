# A/B Street Instructions

This is an alpha-quality demo. Please email <dabreegster@gmail.com> or
[file a Github issue](https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/issues/) if you
hit problems.

## Installing the game

Grab a pre-built binary release -- updated every Sunday, announced at
[r/abstreet](http://old.reddit.com/r/abstreet):

- Windows:
  https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.1.42/abstreet_windows_v0_1_42.zip
- Mac:
  https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.1.42/abstreet_mac_v0_1_42.zip
- Linux:
  https://github.com/dabreegster/abstreet/releases/download/v0.1.42/abstreet_linux_v0_1_42.zip

Unzip the folder, then run `play_abstreet.sh` or `play_abstreet.bat`. On
Windows, you'll probably get a warning about running software from an unknown
publisher.

Or you can [build from source](/docs/dev.md).

## Playing the game

- Use the **tutorial** to learn the controls. As of May 2020, **some stages are
  broken**. Will be fixed soon.
- Play the **challenges** for directed gameplay. As of May 2020, these're under
  active development.
- Try out any ideas in the **sandbox**.
